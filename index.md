
## Biography
I am currently an AI researcher at [Minimax](https://www.minimaxi.com/en).
Before joining Minimax, I worked at Meituan for one year. 
Before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in 2016 and earned my Doctoral degree in 2021 at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests encompass Large Language Models, Deep Learning and Recommender Systems.

I have served as a reviewer for the following conferences:

- ICLR: 2022~2025
- ICML: 2021~2025
- NeurIPS: 2020~2024
- AAAI: 2021~2022
