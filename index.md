
## Biography
I am now a machine learning researcher of [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/en). Prior to joining Meituan, I received my bachelor degree in 2016, and got my doctoral degree in 2021 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests include recommender systems and deep learning. I serve as PC members of AAAI, ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR.
